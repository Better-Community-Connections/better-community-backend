## Components

Livewire components are stored in `app/Http/Livewire`. Each component is a PHP class that extends `Livewire\Component`. They handle interactivity and dynamic behavior.

## Authentication

Breeze sets up basic authentication. It provides routes, controllers, and views for registration, login, password reset, and email verification. Authentication views are stored in `resources/views/auth`.

## Routes

- `routes/web.php`: Contains routes for web pages.
- Livewire components can have their own routes defined within the component itself.

## Models

Models, stored in `app/Models`, represent data structures and interact with the database. They allow you to perform CRUD operations on your data.

## Views

- Blade templates, stored in `resources/views`, generate HTML for your application.
- Livewire components have their own views in `resources/views/livewire`.

## Assets

- `resources/css` and `resources/js` contain your custom styles and scripts.
- Laravel Mix is used to compile and minify assets. Configuration is in `webpack.mix.js`.
